# Lab Assignment #1 - Map and Portfolio

### Due 7/3
Time to put your skills to the test and create a home page for the individual maps that you will be making this quarter. Describe some of your interests and include a map with some markers. This is your portfolio, so feel free toadd anything. If you made multiple HTML pages, please link them all to the `index.html` using the `<a href=""></a>` tag>.

Your portfolio must contain the following:

- A [`<h1>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) for your title
- Add at least 2-3 markers to the map with a common theme, for example organizations you've volunteered for or places you've traveled.
- A `<h2>` or [`<h3>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) to create a title for your map. 
- A [`<p>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) for a paragraph describing yourself and your goals as a critical digital map maker.
- Style CSS by changing the background color, font, or anything else.
- Use an ordered list [`<ol>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) and an unordered list [`<ul>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) to list things.
- Include an [`<img>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) with a photo of yourself or an avatar. Feel free to add other images too to give some flavor to your page, like food or desserts.
- Use the [`<a>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) to add a link to 2 other web pages.
- [Commit](https://github.com/albertkun/211A-ASIAAM-191A/blob/master/Guides/git_commit.md) your changes
