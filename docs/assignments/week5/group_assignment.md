# Group Assignment #4 - Rough Draft

### Due 7/24 or 7/29

Create a functional (doesn't have to be pretty or clean) version of your mapplication using the survey from students in class. 

This assignment will be graded on the following:

1. Fulfillment of the user stories set forth in the memo

2. Relevant functionality that is specific to empowering community voices

3. An updated `readme.md` for the repository that describes:

   - The technology used for the project

   - How others could use this in the future (feel free to reference the memo's long term impact section)

4. A very short 3-minute presentation answering:
   - Who is the project for and why is it important?
   - How does the website empower people?
   - What changes you would like to focus on between now and the final? Why?


**Everyone is required to speak.**
