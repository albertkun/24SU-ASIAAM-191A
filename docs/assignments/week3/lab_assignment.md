# üìùLab Assignment #3 - GeoJSONs and Loops

## Due 7/17 Wednesday

In this week's lab, we learned how to loop through data and connect to an API. Your task is to create a mini-version of the final group project for the class that takes in data and maps it.

The requirements are:

- Create your own geoJSON file using [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/)
- Add your geoJSON data to your map using a [`fetch-then`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) request
- Use any type of [for-loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) within a [JavaScript function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function) to add your geoJSON features to your map.

## Extra credit

- Populate your HTML with data from the geojson
- Use circle markers or custom icons for your geoJSON features.
- Style your map features with a color or size based on a property in your geoJSON file.
- Create a new page for your portfolio for this map

## Submission
