# üìùLab Assignment #4 - APIs and conditionals

## Due 7/24 Wednesday

In this week's lab, we learned how to loop through data and connect to an API. Your task is to create a mini-version of the final group project for the class that takes in data and maps it.

The requirements are:

- Use any type of [for-loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) within a [JavaScript function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function) that adds API data from your Google Spreadsheet form.
- Add data from Google Spreadsheets into your map using PapaParse
- Add an [if-conditional](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp) statement to your loop that changes the marker based on the data
- Add a pop-up with at least 2 fields from the Google Form.
- **Note: **Your Google Form CANNOT be the same topic as the lab (COVID Vaccination)

## Extra credit

- Style the markers based on the form data
- Add a legend describing the markers
