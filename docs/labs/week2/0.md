# The API KEY to BaseMaps

MapLibreGL is a powerful tool that allows you to create beautiful maps. However, it requires an API key to access the base maps. In this lab, you will learn how to get an API key and use it in your code.

You may have noticed that I provided an API key in the email sent last week:

=== "After fix"
	```js
	// Initialize the map
	const map = new maplibregl.Map({
		container: 'map', // container ID
		style: 'https://api.maptiler.com/maps/streets/style.json?key=wsyYBQjqRwKnNsZrtci1', // Your style URL
		center: [-118.45, 34.05], // Starting position [lng, lat]
		zoom: 12 // Starting zoom level
	});
	```

=== "Before fix"

	```js
	// Initialize the map
	const map = new maplibregl.Map({
		container: 'map', // container ID
		style: 'https://api.maptiler.com/maps/streets/style.json?key=get_your_own_OpIi9ZULNHzrESv6T2vL', // Your style URL
		center: [-118.45, 34.05], // Starting position [lng, lat]
		zoom: 12 // Starting zoom level
	});
	```

Unfortunately, this key is not valid `get_your_own_OpIi9ZULNHzrESv6T2vL`.

While you can use this key for now, it is recommended that you get your own API key. This will allow you to use MapLibreGL in your projects without any restrictions.

## Getting an API Key

To get an API key, you need to sign up for a free account on [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/). Once you have signed up, you can generate an API key by following these steps:

1. Log in to your MapTiler account.
2. Click on the `API` tab in the top menu.
3. Click on the `Create API Key` button.
4. Enter a name for your API key (e.g., `MapLibreGL Key`).
5. Click on the `Create` button.
6. Copy the API key and paste it into your code.
7. Save your changes and refresh the page.
8. You should now see the base map displayed on your map.

## Protecting Your API Key

To limit who can access your API key, you can restrict it to specific domains. This will prevent unauthorized users from using your key in their projects.

To restrict your API key, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your MapTiler account.
2. Click on the `API` tab in the top menu.
3. Click on the `Edit` button next to your API key.
4. Under the `Allowed Referrers` section, enter the domain(s) that you want to allow access to your key:
	-  `localhost:5500`
	-  `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io`
5. Click on the `Save` button.
6. Your API key is now restricted to the specified domains.

!!! info What is a `domain`
	A domain is the address of a website, such as `localhost` or `github.io`. By restricting your API key to specific domains, you can control where it can be used. You also buy a domain name to make your website more professional, like `www.albert.com` but they need to be unique and you need to pay for them. Read more on MDN here: [Understanding domain names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name)

After following these steps, your API key will only work on the specified domains, which is the localhost and your GitHub Pages site. This will help protect your key from unauthorized use.
