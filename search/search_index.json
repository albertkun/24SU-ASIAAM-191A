Maps exist in many forms, can represent different ideas and are used for many purposes. In choosing what to represent, how to represent it and what not to represent, maps are expressions of power.\u201d </p> <p>\u2013Logan Cochrane, Jon Corbett and Peter Keller, Impact of Community-based and Participatory Mapping</p>"}, {"location": "syllabus/#course-description", "title": "Course Description", "text": "<p>Welcome to our journey into web programming and mapping! This course has no pre-requisites as it is designed for non-mappers and non-coders to bridge the divide between spatial data and its application in the non-profit world for activism.</p> <p>Spatial data is all around us, whether it\u2019s survey information with zip codes or the various landmarks that comprise what people consider their neighborhood. While maps, like census tracts or political boundaries, are traditionally extensions of authorities of power, participatory mapping seeks to break down those barriers. The objective of this course is to put mapping into the hands of students so that we can transfer these skills and frameworks to civil society.</p> <p>Recent student protests at UCLA during May 2024, where peaceful pro-Palestinian students, staff, and faculty members faced police brutality, highlight the urgent need for change and the power of collective action. The way COVID-19 played out in the United States underscored the institutional problems related to health, inequality, and the environment. The global crisis of climate change reinforces the institutional racism and environmental issues that have proliferated far beyond the U.S. national borders. These challenges all underscore the importance of building coalitions and using data and maps, as tools to communicate, organize, and drive change.</p> <p>Given all these issues, more so than ever, civil society is needed to build the coalitions and reassess priorities to usher in an era of political change. Mapping and data, are transformative tools that when used effectively can strengthen these connections between coalitions because they are representations of the physical world around us. </p> <p>However, in non-profits and other fields of civic engagement, these skills are underutilized or simply seen as something \u201cleft to the experts\u201d.
